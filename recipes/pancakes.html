        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <!-- List the ingredients  -->
         <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (300g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cups (480ml) whole milk, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>About 3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
         </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the batter:</strong>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
                Add the milk and eggs and whisk to form a smooth, pourable batter. The batter should be thinner than American pancakes and thicker than crepe batter. You may need to add a little extra milk to get the right consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Heat the skillet:</strong>Set a large non-stick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of butter (in a cast-iron skillet I use closer to 1 tablespoon). When the temperature is right, the butter should melt, sizzle, and foam. 
                Swirl the butter to coat the bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the pancakes:</strong>Once the butter stops foaming, take the pan off the heat and pour 1/2 to 2/3 cup of batter into the pan for medium or large pancakes. Swirl the pan to spread the batter along the bottom of the pan, then place back on the heat.
                If you’re adding any mix-ins, like thinly sliced apple, add them now and press lightly into the surface of the pancake. Cook until the top of the pancake is dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1 to 2 minutes more. The pancakes should be golden brown in a speckled, honeycomb pattern.
                Repeat with the remaining butter and batter. Stack the finished pancakes as you go on a large plate and cover them with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm while cooking the rest. Or serve them straight from the pan as you go.
